To put it simply, a NoSQL database is a database that does not use SQL (Structured Query Language). Each NoSQL typically has its own way of writing and executing queries. For example, MongoDB uses MQL (MongoDB Query Language) and ElasticSearch simply has a JSON API.

While most relational databases are fairly similar, NoSQL databases tend to be fairly unique and are used for more niche purposes. Some of the main differences between a SQL and NoSQL databases are:

NoSQL databases are usually non-relational, SQL databases are usually relational (we'll talk more about what this means later).
SQL databases usually have a defined schema, NoSQL databases usually have dynamic schema.
SQL databases are table-based, NoSQL databases have a variety of different storage methods, such as document, key-value, graph, wide-column, and more.

DIFFRENCES:
->Sure, let's break it down into beginner-friendly points:

  AMOUNT INTEGER
);

SQL DELETE , INSERT,UPDATE FUNCTIONS

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into each of these SQL functions:

1. **DELETE Function**:
   - **Additional Considerations**:
     - **Using Subqueries**: DELETE statements can include subqueries to delete records based on conditions derived from other tables.
       ```sql
       DELETE FROM Orders WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT id FROM Customers WHERE age < 18);
       ```
     - **Truncating Table**: Alternatively, TRUNCATE TABLE can be used to quickly remove all records from a table without logging individual row deletions. This operation is faster than DELETE, but it cannot be undone and does not trigger DELETE triggers.
       ```sql
       TRUNCATE TABLE People;
       ```
   - **Transactional Behavior**: DELETE statements are typically executed within transactions. It's crucial to consider transaction isolation levels and potential concurrency issues, such as phantom reads or locking contention, especially in high-transaction environments.

2. **UPDATE Function**:
   - **Additional Considerations**:
     - **Using Joins**: UPDATE statements can leverage JOIN operations to update records based on related data from other tables.
       ```sql
       UPDATE Orders
       SET status = 'Shipped'
       FROM Orders
       INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.id
       WHERE Customers.country = 'USA';
       ```
     - **Batch Updates**: When updating a large number of records, consider batching updates to minimize locking contention and optimize performance.
     - **Using CASE Statements**: CASE statements within UPDATE queries enable conditional updates based on specific criteria.
       ```sql
       UPDATE Products
       SET price = CASE
                     WHEN category = 'Electronics' THEN price * 1.1
                     WHEN category = 'Clothing' THEN price * 1.05
                     ELSE price
                   END;
       ```
   - **Data Integrity Constraints**: Ensure that updates adhere to data integrity constraints, such as foreign key constraints or check constraints, to maintain data consistency and prevent invalid updates.

3. **INSERT (ADD) Function**:
   - **Additional Considerations**:
     - **Using SELECT**: INSERT statements can be combined with SELECT queries to insert data from one table into another based on specific conditions or transformations.
       ```sql
       INSERT INTO NewTable (col1, col2, ...)
       SELECT col1, col2, ...
       FROM OldTable
       WHERE condition;
       ```
     - **Bulk Inserts**: For inserting large volumes of data, consider using bulk insert methods provided by database systems for improved performance.
     - **Returning Values**: Some database systems support returning values from INSERT statements, allowing retrieval of generated keys or computed columns.
       ```sql
       INSERT INTO People (name, age)
       VALUES ('John', 30)
       RETURNING id;
       ```
   - **Identity Columns**: When inserting into tables with auto-incrementing or identity columns, ensure proper handling of these columns to avoid conflicts and maintain data integrity.

4. **Transactions and Rollback**:
   - **Transactions**: Wrap multiple SQL statements, including DELETE, UPDATE, and INSERT operations, within a transaction to ensure atomicity and consistency.
   - **Rollback**: In case of errors or unexpected outcomes, utilize ROLLBACK statements to revert changes made by DELETE, UPDATE, or INSERT operations within the transaction.
   - **Transaction Management**: Understand transaction isolation levels and transaction boundaries to maintain data integrity and prevent issues like dirty reads or lost updates.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Indexing**: Analyze query execution plans and consider creating indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses to improve performance, especially for DELETE and UPDATE statements.
   - **Query Tuning**: Optimize SQL queries using techniques like query rewriting, query plan analysis, and database schema optimization to enhance DELETE, UPDATE, and INSERT performance.
   - **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing techniques, such as batching DELETE or UPDATE statements, to reduce round-trips to the database and minimize overhead.

By understanding these additional considerations and best practices, you can leverage the full power of DELETE, UPDATE, and INSERT functions in SQL to efficiently manage and manipulate data within tables while ensuring data integrity and optimizing performance.

            MIGRATIONS IN SQL





In SQL, migrations refer to the process of managing and applying changes to a database schema over time. These changes can include creating new tables, modifying existing tables, adding or removing columns, and establishing relationships between tables. Migrations are essential for maintaining the integrity of the database structure and ensuring compatibility with evolving application requirements. Let's delve into the types of migrations in detail:

1. **Schema Migrations**:

   - **Examples**:
     - Creating a new table to store user profiles.
     - Adding a new column to an existing table to capture additional information.
     - Modifying the data type of a column to accommodate changing requirements.
   - **Tools**: Various tools and frameworks, such as Flyway, Liquibase, and Django Migrations (for Django projects), provide support for managing schema migrations efficiently.

2. **Data Migrations**:
   - **Purpose**: Data migrations involve transferring and transforming data within the database, often accompanying schema changes to ensure data integrity and consistency.
   - **Examples**:
     - Populating newly created tables with initial data.
     - Updating existing data to comply with schema modifications.
     - Merging or splitting data across multiple tables.
   - **Tools**: Data migration tasks can be implemented using SQL scripts or custom scripts written in programming languages like Python or Java. Frameworks like Django Migrations also offer built-in support for data migrations.

3. **Version Control Migrations**:
   - **Purpose**: Version control migrations track and manage changes to the database schema over time, providing a historical record of modifications and enabling collaboration among developers.
   - **Examples**:
     - Maintaining a series of migration files in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes made to the schema.
     - Applying migrations sequentially to update databases across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
   - **Tools**: Version control systems like Git, combined with migration management tools, facilitate tracking and applying database schema changes in a controlled and auditable manner.

4. **Rollback Migrations**:
   - **Purpose**: Rollback migrations enable reverting applied changes to the database schema or data, restoring the database to a previous state in case of errors or unforeseen issues.
   - **Examples**:
     - Rolling back a failed migration that caused data corruption or schema inconsistency.
     - Reverting to a previous version of the database schema to address compatibility issues or performance regressions.
   - **Tools**: Migration frameworks often provide mechanisms for rolling back migrations, either automatically or through manual intervention, to undo changes and restore database integrity.

5. **Cross-Platform Migrations**:
   - **Purpose**: Cross-platform migrations involve transferring data and schema structures between different database management systems (DBMS), enabling migration from one DBMS to another or supporting multi-platform environments.
   - **Examples**:
     - Migrating a database from MySQL to PostgreSQL to leverage specific features or improve performance.
     - Synchronizing data between on-premises databases and cloud-based databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL).
   - **Tools**: Tools like AWS Database Migration Service, pgloader, and open-source libraries provide capabilities for cross-platform migrations, facilitating seamless transitions between different database environments.

Overall, migrations play a crucial role in database management, allowing for systematic and controlled modifications to the database schema and data. By understanding the different types of migrations and utilizing appropriate tools and strategies, developers can ensure the consistency, integrity, and scalability of their databases across various stages of application development and deployment.



"Up" and "down" are concepts commonly associated with database migrations. Let's break down what they mean in the context of managing database schema changes:

1. **Up Migration**:
   - **Purpose**: The "up" migration represents the action of applying a migration to the database schema. It involves making changes or additions to the schema, such as creating tables, adding columns, or defining constraints.
   - **Execution**: When running an "up" migration, the changes specified in the migration file are executed sequentially, altering the database schema to reflect the desired state defined in the migration.
   - **Example**: An "up" migration file might contain SQL statements to create a new table to store user information, add indexes for performance optimization, or modify existing columns to accommodate new requirements.

2. **Down Migration**:
   - **Purpose**: The "down" migration is the counterpart to the "up" migration and represents the action of reverting or rolling back changes made by a previous migration. It aims to undo the modifications applied to the database schema in the "up" migration.
   - **Execution**: When executing a "down" migration, the changes specified in the migration file are executed in reverse order compared to the "up" migration, effectively reversing the alterations made to the schema.
   - **Example**: A "down" migration file might contain SQL statements to drop a table created in a previous migration, remove columns added in an earlier migration, or revert constraints or indexes that are no longer needed.

3. **Usage**:
   - **Migration Workflow**: In a typical migration workflow, developers create "up" migration files to implement schema changes and ensure forward compatibility with new application versions. If needed, corresponding "down" migration files are also created to provide an orderly way to revert changes during development or in case of issues.
   - **Rolling Back Changes**: In situations where a migration causes unexpected issues or errors, the "down" migration is utilized to roll back the changes, restoring the database schema to its previous state. This allows developers to address problems quickly without disrupting application functionality.

4. **Migration Management**:
   - **Tracking State**: Migration frameworks often maintain a record of applied migrations, tracking the current state of the database schema and facilitating the execution of "up" and "down" migrations as needed.
   - **Automated Rollbacks**: Some migration tools offer automated rollback mechanisms, enabling developers to revert to the previous state of the database with minimal manual intervention in case of migration failures or errors.
   - **Version Control**: Migration files, including both "up" and "down" migrations, are typically stored in version control systems (e.g., Git) to provide a history of schema changes and ensure consistency across development environments.

In summary, "up" and "down" migrations are integral components of database migration workflows, enabling developers to apply and revert schema changes systematically while maintaining the integrity and consistency of the database schema across different stages of application development and deployment.




Certainly, let's clarify the actual difference between "up" and "down" in the context of database migrations:

1. **Up Migration**:
   - **Purpose**: The "up" migration represents the action of applying a migration to the database schema.
   - **Changes**: It introduces changes to the database schema, such as creating tables, adding columns, or defining constraints.
   - **Direction**: The "up" direction moves the database schema forward to reflect the desired state defined in the migration.
   - **Execution**: When running an "up" migration, the changes specified in the migration file are executed sequentially, altering the database schema.

2. **Down Migration**:
   - **Purpose**: The "down" migration is the counterpart to the "up" migration and represents the action of reverting or rolling back changes made by a previous migration.
   - **Reversal**: It aims to undo the modifications applied to the database schema in the "up" migration, effectively reverting the changes.
   - **Direction**: The "down" direction moves the database schema backward to its previous state before the "up" migration.
   - **Execution**: When executing a "down" migration, the changes specified in the migration file are executed in reverse order compared to the "up" migration, effectively reversing the alterations made to the schema.

In summary, the key difference lies in the direction of the changes applied to the database schema:

- **Up Migration**: Introduces changes to move the database schema forward.
- **Down Migration**: Reverts changes to move the database schema backward to its previous state.

Together, "up" and "down" migrations provide a systematic and controlled way to manage database schema changes, allowing developers to apply changes to the schema and revert them if necessary, while ensuring the integrity and consistency of the database structure.

- Primary keys enforce entity integrity, ensuring that each record in the table is uniquely identifiable.
- Only one primary key can exist per table.
- Primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables as foreign keys.
- Example: In a "Students" table, the "student_id" column could serve as the primary key.

**Foreign Key:**
- A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a database table that establishes a link between data in two tables.
- It refers to the primary key of another table, creating a parent-child relationship between the two tables.
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that data in the child table (referencing table) corresponds to valid data in the parent table (referenced table).
- Multiple foreign keys can exist in a table, each referencing different parent tables.
- Foreign keys can have null values, indicating that the relationship is optional.
- Example: In a "Courses" table, a "student_id" column could serve as a foreign key referencing the "student_id" column in the "Students" table.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Purpose**: 
   - The primary key uniquely identifies each row within a single table.
   - The foreign key establishes relationships between data in different tables.

2. **Uniqueness**:
   - Primary keys must contain unique values and cannot be null.
   - Foreign keys may contain duplicate values and can be null, depending on the relationship's cardinality.

3. **Constraint Enforcement**:
   - Primary keys enforce entity integrity, ensuring each row is uniquely identifiable within the table.
   - Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, maintaining consistency between related tables.

4. **Multiplicity**:
   - Each table can have only one primary key.
   - A table can have multiple foreign keys, each referencing a different parent table.

5. **Role in Relationships**:
   - Primary keys are used to establish relationships by being referenced as foreign keys in other tables.
   - Foreign keys establish the relationship by referencing the primary key of another table.

6. **Data Type**:
   - Primary keys are typically of a unique data type, often integers or GUIDs.
   - Foreign keys have the same data type as the primary key they reference in the parent table.

In summary, while primary keys uniquely identify rows within a table, foreign keys establish relationships between tables by referencing primary keys. Both keys play crucial roles in maintaining data integrity and establishing associations between related data.\



                   SCHEMA



A database schema is a logical blueprint or structure that defines the organization, relationships, and constraints of data stored in a database. It represents the skeleton or framework of the database, outlining how data is organized into tables, columns, and relationships between them. Here are the key aspects of a database schema:

1. **Tables**: A schema defines tables, which are the basic structures used to store data. Each table represents a distinct entity, such as customers, orders, or products, and consists of rows and columns.

2. **Columns**: Within each table, columns represent the attributes or properties of the entity being modeled. For example, in a "Customers" table, columns might include "customer_id", "name", "email", and "phone_number".

3. **Data Types**: The schema specifies the data types for each column, determining the kind of data that can be stored in it. Common data types include integers, strings, dates, and boolean values.

4. **Constraints**: Constraints define rules or conditions that govern the data stored in the database. Common constraints include primary key constraints (ensuring uniqueness), foreign key constraints (maintaining referential integrity), and check constraints (validating data against specified conditions).

5. **Relationships**: The schema establishes relationships between tables through foreign keys, which define associations between rows in different tables. For example, in a relational database, a foreign key in the "Orders" table might reference the "customer_id" column in the "Customers" table, linking each order to its corresponding customer.

6. **Indexes**: Although not always explicitly defined in the schema, indexes are often used to optimize data retrieval by providing fast access to specific columns or combinations of columns. Indexes can improve query performance but may also impose overhead on data modification operations.

7. **Views, Stored Procedures, and Functions**: In addition to tables and relationships, a database schema may include views, stored procedures, and functions. Views represent virtual tables derived from one or more underlying tables, while stored procedures and functions encapsulate reusable logic for performing operations on the data.

Overall, a database schema serves as a crucial foundation for organizing and managing data within a database system. It provides a structured framework that guides the design, implementation, and maintenance of databases, ensuring consistency, integrity, and efficiency in data management operations.


               RELATIONAL DATABASES


Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. These databases adhere to the principles of the relational model, developed by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s. Here's a detailed overview of relational databases:

1. **Tables**: Relational databases store data in tables, where each table represents a distinct entity or relationship. Tables are organized into rows (also known as tuples or records) and columns (also known as attributes or fields), with each column representing a specific attribute of the entity.

2. **Relationships**: Relationships between tables are established through keys, primarily using primary and foreign keys:
   - **Primary Key**: A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that each record is unique and serves as a unique identifier for that entity.
   - **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

3. **Normalization**: Relational databases employ normalization techniques to reduce data redundancy and dependency, ensuring data integrity and efficiency. Normalization involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable tables and organizing them to eliminate redundant data.

4. **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It provides commands for creating, querying, updating, and deleting data in tables, as well as defining relationships, constraints, and indexes.

5. **ACID Properties**: Relational databases adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure transactional consistency and reliability:
   - **Atomicity**: Transactions are atomic, meaning they either complete in full or are rolled back to their initial state if they fail midway.
   - **Consistency**: Transactions preserve the consistency of the database, ensuring that data remains valid before and after each transaction.
   - **Isolation**: Transactions occur in isolation from each other, preventing interference and maintaining data integrity.
   - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently stored in the database, even in the event of system failures or crashes.

6. **Data Integrity**: Relational databases enforce data integrity through various constraints, including:
   - **Primary Key Constraint**: Ensures the uniqueness of values in a primary key column.
   - **Foreign Key Constraint**: Maintains referential integrity by ensuring that values in foreign key columns correspond to existing values in the primary key column of another table.
   - **Check Constraint**: Validates data against specified conditions to ensure its correctness.

7. **Scalability and Performance**: Relational databases can scale vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) or horizontally (by distributing data across multiple servers) to accommodate growing data volumes and user loads. They often utilize indexing, caching, and query optimization techniques to enhance performance.

8. **Examples**: Popular relational database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

Overall, relational databases provide a robust and flexible framework for storing, managing, and querying structured data, making them widely used in various applications and industries, including finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more.

        RELATIONAL VS NON RELATIONAL


Relational databases (RDBMS) and non-relational databases (NoSQL databases) are two distinct types of database management systems, each designed to address different data storage and retrieval requirements. Here's a comparison between the two:

**Relational Databases (RDBMS):**

1. **Structure:**
   - Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns.
   - Each table represents a distinct entity, and relationships between entities are established through primary and foreign keys.

2. **Schema:**
   - Relational databases typically follow a predefined schema, which defines the structure, data types, and constraints of the data stored in tables.
   - Changes to the schema may require altering the entire database structure, potentially leading to downtime during schema migrations.

3. **ACID Properties:**
   - Relational databases adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure transactional consistency and reliability.
   - Transactions in relational databases are typically strongly consistent, meaning that data remains consistent at all times.

4. **Query Language:**
   - Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.
   - SQL provides powerful querying capabilities for retrieving, updating, and manipulating data stored in tables.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Relational databases can scale vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) and, to some extent, horizontally (through techniques like sharding or replication).
   - Vertical scaling may have limitations in terms of the maximum capacity of a single server.

**Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):**

1. **Structure:**
   - NoSQL databases store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores, depending on the database type.
   - They do not require a fixed schema, allowing for flexibility in data representation.

2. **Schema Flexibility:**
   - NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility, allowing for dynamic changes to the data structure without requiring a predefined schema.
   - This flexibility is beneficial for handling semi-structured or unstructured data types.

3. **Consistency Models:**
   - NoSQL databases often provide different consistency models, such as eventual consistency, strong consistency, or eventual consistency, allowing users to choose between consistency and availability.
   - Some NoSQL databases sacrifice strong consistency in favor of performance and scalability.

4. **Query Language:**
   - While some NoSQL databases support SQL-like query languages (e.g., Cassandra Query Language for Apache Cassandra), many NoSQL databases offer proprietary query languages or APIs tailored to specific data models.

5. **Scalability:**
   - NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to handle large volumes of data and high throughput by distributing data across multiple servers.
   - They can scale out by adding more nodes to a cluster without the same limitations as vertical scaling.

**Key Differences:**

1. **Data Model:**
   - Relational databases use a tabular data model with structured data.
   - NoSQL databases support various data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph models, catering to different data storage and retrieval needs.

2. **Schema Flexibility:**
   - Relational databases enforce a rigid schema with predefined structure and constraints.
   - NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility, allowing for dynamic changes to the data model without requiring alterations to the entire database schema.

3. **Consistency vs. Scalability:**
   - Relational databases prioritize consistency and transactional integrity, making them suitable for applications requiring strong data consistency guarantees.
   - NoSQL databases prioritize scalability and performance, often at the expense of strict consistency, making them suitable for applications with high scalability and availability requirements.

4. **Use Cases:**
   - Relational databases are well-suited for applications with complex relationships, strict data integrity requirements, and transactional workloads, such as e-commerce platforms, financial systems, and enterprise applications.
   - NoSQL databases are commonly used in applications with large-scale data storage and retrieval needs, such as web applications, content management systems, real-time analytics, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

In summary, the choice between relational and non-relational databases depends on factors such as data structure, consistency requirements, scalability needs, and the specific use case of the application. While relational databases offer strong consistency and structured data management, NoSQL databases provide flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages for handling diverse data types and high-volume workloads.

     CHAPTER 4-----> CRUD


     CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It represents the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or similar data storage system. Here's a brief explanation of each CRUD operation:

1. **Create (C):**
   - The Create operation involves adding new data records or entities to the database.
   - It typically involves inserting a new row into a table in a relational database or adding a new document to a collection in a NoSQL database.
   - Example: Creating a new user account by inserting a new row into the "Users" table with relevant information such as username, email, and password.

2. **Read (R):**
   - The Read operation involves retrieving or querying existing data from the database.
   - It allows users to access and view data stored in the database based on specific criteria or conditions.
   - Examples include fetching a user's profile information, retrieving a list of products from a catalog, or querying sales data for a specific time period.

3. **Update (U):**
   - The Update operation involves modifying or updating existing data records in the database.
   - It allows users to make changes to data attributes or values, such as updating a user's profile information or modifying product details.
   - Example: Changing the email address associated with a user account or updating the quantity of a product in inventory.

4. **Delete (D):**
   - The Delete operation involves removing or deleting existing data records from the database.
   - It permanently removes data from the database, reducing the size of the dataset.
   - Example: Deleting a user account and all associated data from the database, such as profile information, preferences, and order history.

CRUD operations are fundamental to database management and are commonly implemented in database systems, application programming interfaces (APIs), and web services. They provide the basic functionality required for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data, enabling users to interact with and manipulate data stored in the database effectively.



CRUD
CRUD is an acronym that stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. These four operations are the bread and butter of nearly every database you will create.

HTTP AND CRUD
The CRUD operations correlate nicely with the HTTP methods we learned in the Learn HTTP course.

HTTP POST - CREATE
HTTP GET - READ
HTTP PUT - UPDATE
HTTP DELETE - DELETE

HOW ARE HTTP AND CRUD RELATED?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are related in the context of web applications and RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer). Here's how they are connected:

1. **HTTP Methods:**
   - HTTP defines a set of request methods (or HTTP verbs) that specify the desired action to be performed on a resource. These methods align closely with the CRUD operations:
     - **GET**: Used for retrieving data from a server (Read operation).
     - **POST**: Used for sending data to a server to create a new resource (Create operation).
     - **PUT or PATCH**: Used for updating an existing resource on the server (Update operation). PUT typically updates the entire resource, while PATCH updates only specific fields.
     - **DELETE**: Used for deleting a resource on the server (Delete operation).

2. **Mapping CRUD Operations to HTTP Methods:**
   - In a RESTful API, HTTP methods are mapped to CRUD operations as follows:
     - **GET**: Retrieves data from the server. It corresponds to the Read operation in CRUD, allowing clients to retrieve existing resources.
     - **POST**: Creates a new resource on the server. It corresponds to the Create operation in CRUD, enabling clients to add new data to the database.
     - **PUT or PATCH**: Updates an existing resource on the server. These methods correspond to the Update operation in CRUD, allowing clients to modify existing data.
     - **DELETE**: Removes an existing resource from the server. It corresponds to the Delete operation in CRUD, enabling clients to delete unwanted data.

3. **RESTful API Design:**
   - RESTful APIs leverage HTTP methods to implement CRUD functionality in a standardized and uniform manner.
   - Each HTTP method corresponds to a specific action on the server, making API endpoints self-descriptive and intuitive.
   - By adhering to RESTful principles and mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations, developers can design APIs that are easy to understand, use, and maintain.

4. **Example:**
   - For example, consider a web application for managing user accounts. The application may have the following HTTP endpoints mapped to CRUD operations:
     - **GET /users**: Retrieves a list of all users (Read operation).
     - **POST /users**: Creates a new user account (Create operation).
     - **PUT /users/{id}**: Updates an existing user's information (Update operation).
     - **DELETE /users/{id}**: Deletes a user account (Delete operation).

In summary, HTTP methods and CRUD operations are closely related in the context of web development, particularly in the design and implementation of RESTful APIs. HTTP methods provide a standardized mechanism for performing CRUD operations on resources, enabling clients to interact with server-side data effectively and efficiently.

INSERT STATEMENT
Tables are pretty useless without data in them! In SQL we can add records to a table using an INSERT INTO statement. When using an INSERT statement we must first specify the table we are inserting the record into, followed by the fields within that table we want to add VALUES to.
A FRONT END TYPICALLY COMMUNICATES WITH A DATABASES DIRECTLY TO ADD NEW RECORDS-->FALSE

The HTTP CRUD database lifecycle refers to the sequence of actions performed by a client application using HTTP methods to interact with a database through a RESTful API. It encompasses the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations commonly associated with database management. Here's an overview of each stage in the HTTP CRUD database lifecycle:

1. **Create (HTTP POST)**:
   - In the creation phase, the client application sends an HTTP POST request to the server to add new data to the database.
   - The request includes the data to be added, typically in the form of JSON or XML, as the request body.
   - Upon receiving the POST request, the server processes the data and creates a new resource in the database.
   - The server then responds with an HTTP status code indicating the success or failure of the operation, along with any relevant data about the newly created resource.

2. **Read (HTTP GET)**:
   - In the read phase, the client application sends an HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve existing data from the database.
   - The request may include parameters to specify the criteria for data retrieval, such as filters or pagination.
   - The server processes the GET request, fetches the requested data from the database, and returns it to the client as an HTTP response.
   - The response typically includes the requested data in the response body, along with an appropriate HTTP status code indicating the success of the operation.

3. **Update (HTTP PUT or PATCH)**:
   - In the update phase, the client application sends an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to the server to modify existing data in the database.
   - The request includes the updated data, typically in the form of JSON or XML, as the request body.
   - Depending on the semantics of the API, the client may use either PUT (to update the entire resource) or PATCH (to update specific fields) for the update operation.
   - The server processes the request, applies the updates to the corresponding resource in the database, and returns an HTTP response indicating the success or failure of the operation.

4. **Delete (HTTP DELETE)**:
   - In the delete phase, the client application sends an HTTP DELETE request to the server to remove existing data from the database.
   - The request typically includes the identifier of the resource to be deleted, such as a unique identifier or a URL path.
   - Upon receiving the DELETE request, the server processes the request, deletes the specified resource from the database, and returns an HTTP response indicating the success of the operation.

Throughout the HTTP CRUD database lifecycle, client applications interact with the server using standard HTTP methods, enabling them to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database resources via a RESTful API. This lifecycle forms the foundation for building web applications and services that leverage HTTP for data management and communication.


THE CREATE CRUD MAPS TO WHICH SQL STATEMENTS AND HTTP METHOD?
-> INSERT,POST



AUTO INCREMENT
Many dialects of SQL support an AUTO INCREMENT feature. When inserting records into a table with AUTO INCREMENT enabled, the database will assign the next value automatically. In SQLite an integer id field that has the PRIMARY KEY constraint will auto increment by default!

ID'S
Depending on how your database is set up, you may be using traditional ids or you may be using UUIDs. SQL doesn't support auto incrementing a uuid so if your database is using them your server will have to handle the changing uuid's for each record.

USING AUTO INCREMENT IN SQLITE
We are using traditional ids in our database, so we can take advantage of the auto increment feature. Different dialects of SQL will implement this feature differently, but in SQLite any id field that has the PRIMARY KEY constraint will auto increment! So we can omit the id field within the INSERT statement and allow the database to automatically add that field for us!

Every time someone creates an account on boot.dev Allan or Lane has to manually add them to the database by hand-writing a SQL query
--->FALSE

WITHIN BACKEND SYSTEMS,SQL QUERIES ARE TYPICALLY--> GENERATED BY CODE.

THE HTTP METHOD THAT GENERALLY CORRESPONDS WITH A SQL SELECT STATEMENT IS HTTP->GET

GET REQUEST IS MADE FIRT TO FIRST BEFORE EVERYTHING.


COUNT
We can use a SELECT statement to get a count of the records within a table. This can be very useful when we need to know how many records there are, but we don't particularly care what's in them.

Here's an example in SQLite:

SELECT count(*) from emp;

          WHERE CLAUSE

   WHERE CLAUSE
In order to keep learning about CRUD operations in SQL, we need to learn how to make the instructions we send to the database more specific. SQL accepts a WHERE statement within a query that allows us to be very specific with our instructions.

If we were unable to specify the specific record we wanted to READ, UPDATE, or DELETE making queries to a database would be very frustrating, and very inefficient.

USING A WHERE CLAUSE
Say we had over 9000 records in our users table. We often want to look at specific user data within that table without retrieving all the other records in the table. We can use a SELECT statement followed by a WHERE clause to specify which records to retrieve. The SELECT statement stays the same, we just add the WHERE clause to the end of the SELECT. Here's an example:

SELECT name FROM users WHERE power_level >= 9000;


This will select only the name field of any user within the users table WHERE the power_level field is greater than or equal to 9000.




THE DANGER OF DELETING DATA
Deleting data can be a dangerous operation. Once removed, data can be really hard if not impossible to restore! Let's talk about a couple of common ways back-end engineers protect against losing valuable customer data.



STRATEGY 1 - BACKUPS
If you're using a cloud-service like GCP's Cloud SQL or AWS's RDS you should always turn on automated backups. They take an automatic snapshot of your entire database on some interval, and keep it around for some length of time.

For example, the Boot.dev database has a backup snapshot taken daily and we retain those backups for 30 days. If I ever accidentally run a query that deletes valuable data, I can restore it from the backup.

You should have a backup strategy for production databases.

STRATEGY 2 - SOFT DELETES
A "soft delete" is when you don't actually delete data from your database, but instead just "mark" the data as deleted. For example, you might set a deleted_at date on the row you want to delete. Then, in your queries you ignore anything that has a deleted_at date set. The idea is that this allows your application to behave as if it's deleting data, but you can always go back and restore any data that's been removed.

You should probably only soft-delete if you have a specific reason to do so. Automated backups should be "good enough" for most applications that are just interested in protecting against developer mistakes.


You should ALMOST ALWAYS  have automated backups being taken of a production database

A soft-delete is where you MARK THE ROW AS DELETED INSTED OF ACTUALLY DELETING THE DATA.


UPDATE QUERY IN SQL
Whenever you update your profile picture or change your password online, you are changing the data in a field on a table in a database! Imagine if every time you accidentally messed up a Tweet on Twitter you had to delete the entire tweet and post a new one instead of just editing it...

...Well, that's a bad example.

UPDATE STATEMENT
The UPDATE statement in SQL allows us to update the fields of a record. We can even update many records depending on how we write the statement.

An UPDATE statement specifies the table that needs to be updated, followed by the fields and their new values by using the SET keyword. Lastly a WHERE clause indicates the record(s) to update.

UPDATE employees
SET job_title = 'Backend Engineer', salary = 150000
WHERE id = 251;



OBJECT-RELATIONAL MAPPING (ORMS)
An Object-Relational Mapping or an ORM for short, is a tool that allows you to perform CRUD operations on a database using a traditional programming language. These typically come in the form of a library or framework that you would use in your backend code.

The primary benefit an ORM provides is that it maps your database records to in-memory objects. For example, in Go we might have a struct that we use in our code:


type User struct {
    ID int
    Name string
    IsAdmin bool
}


WHEN USING AN ORM,YOU CALL METHODS AND FUCTIONS MADE AVALIABLE VIA THE ORM'S API

ADVANTAGE OF ORM IS--> MAKES YOUR CODE LESS VERBOSE(ABSTRACT)

WE SHLD USE ORMN WHEN IT DEPENDS UPON THE  PROJCT/TEAM



          CHAPTER 5---->BASIC QUERIES


AS CLAUSE:

AS CLAUSE IN SQL
Sometimes we need to structure the data we return from our queries in a specific way. An AS clause allows us to "alias" a piece of data in our query. The alias only exists for the duration of the query.

AS KEYWORD
The following queries return the same data:

SELECT employee_id AS id, employee_name AS name
FROM employees;


The difference is that the results from the aliased query would have column names id and name instead of employee_id and employee_name.


SQL FUNCTIONS
SQL is a programming language and like nearly all programming languages, it supports functions. We can use functions and aliases to calculate new columns in a query. This is similar to how you might use formulas in Excel.

IIF FUNCTION
In SQLite, the IIF function works like a ternary. For example,

IIF(carA > carB, "Car a is bigger", "Car b is bigger")

If a is greater than b, this statement evaluates to the string "Car a is bigger". Otherwise, it evaluates to "Car b is bigger".

Here's how we can use IIF() and a directive alias to add a new calculated column to our result set:

SELECT quantity,
    IIF(quantity < 10, "Order more", "In Stock") AS directive
    from products



DISTINCT

DISTINCT
Sometimes we want to retrieve records from a table without getting back any duplicates.

For example, we may want to know all the different companies our employees have worked at previously, but we don't want to see the same company multiple times in the report.

SELECT DISTINCT
SQL offers us the DISTINCT keyword that removes duplicate records from the resulting query

SELECT DISTINCT previous_company
    FROM employees;



BETWEEN
We can check if values are between two numbers using the WHERE clause in an intuitive way! The WHERE clause doesn't always have to be used to specify specific id's or values. We can also use it to help narrow down our result set. Here's an example:

SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 and 60000;


This query returns all the employees name and salary fields for any rows where the salary is BETWEEN 30,000 and 60,000! We can also query results that are NOT BETWEEN two specified values

SELECT product_name, quantity
FROM products
WHERE quantity NOT BETWEEN 20 and 100;

This query returns all the product names where the quantity was not between 20 and 100. We can use conditionals to make the results of our query as specific as we need them to be


DISTINCT
Sometimes we want to retrieve records from a table without getting back any duplicates.

For example, we may want to know all the different companies our employees have worked at previously, but we don't want to see the same company multiple times in the report.

SELECT DISTINCT
SQL offers us the DISTINCT keyword that removes duplicate records from the resulting query.

SELECT DISTINCT previous_company
    FROM employees;

IN
Another variation to the WHERE clause we can utilize is the IN operator. IN returns true or false if the first operand matches any of the values in the second operand. The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

These two queries are equivalent:

SELECT product_name, shipment_status
    FROM products
    WHERE shipment_status IN ('shipped', 'preparing', 'out of stock');


SELECT product_name, shipment_status
    FROM products
    WHERE shipment_status = 'shipped'
        OR shipment_status = 'preparing'
        OR shipment_status = 'out of stock';


Hopefully, you're starting to see how querying specific data using fine-tuned SQL clauses helps reveal important insights! The larger a table becomes the harder it becomes to analyze without proper queries.


LIKE
Sometimes we don't have the luxury of knowing exactly what it is we need to query. Have you ever wanted to look up a song or a video but you only remember part of the name? SQL provides us an option for when we're in situations LIKE this.

The LIKE keyword allows for the use of the % and _ wildcard operators. Let's focus on % first.

% OPERATOR
The % operator will match zero or more characters. We can use this operator within our query string to find more than just exact matches depending on where we place it.

PRODUCT STARTS WITH "BANANA":
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_name LIKE 'banana%';

PRODUCT ENDS WITH "BANANA":
SELECT * from products
WHERE product_name LIKE '%banana';

PRODUCT CONTAINS "BANANA":
SELECT * from products
WHERE product_name LIKE '%banana%';


UNDERSCORE OPERATOR
As discussed, the % wildcard operator matches zero or more characters. Meanwhile, the _ wildcard operator only matches a single character.


SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE product_name LIKE '_oot';

    The query above matches products like:

boot
root
foot

SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE product_name LIKE '__oot';


The query above matches products like:

shoot
groot

 

             CHAPTER 6----->STRUCTURING

LIMIT KEYWORD:


The `LIMIT` keyword is commonly used in SQL queries to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. It is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when pagination is required. Here's how the `LIMIT` keyword works:

- **Syntax**:
  ```
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  [WHERE condition]
  [ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]]
  LIMIT number_of_rows;
  ```

- **Usage**:
  - After the `SELECT` statement, you can specify the columns you want to retrieve data from.
  - The `FROM` clause specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.
  - Optionally, you can include a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on specified conditions.
  - You can use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the result set based on one or more columns.
  - Finally, the `LIMIT` clause specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned by the query.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  ORDER BY hire_date DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
  This query retrieves the 10 most recently hired employees from the `employees` table, sorted in descending order based on their hire date.

- **Pagination**:
  - `LIMIT` is often used in conjunction with `OFFSET` for pagination.
  - The `OFFSET` clause specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the result set.
  - For example, to retrieve rows 11-20, you would use `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10`.

- **Compatibility**:
  - The syntax for the `LIMIT` clause may vary slightly between different database management systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
  - While most relational databases support `LIMIT`, the specific implementation may differ.

Overall, the `LIMIT` keyword is a powerful tool in SQL for controlling the size of result sets, improving query performance, and implementing pagination in applications that interact with databases.


Sometimes we don't want to retrieve every record from a table. For example, it's common for a production database table to have millions of rows, and SELECTing all of them might crash your system! The LIMIT keyword has entered the chat.

The LIMIT keyword can be used at the end of a select statement to reduce the number of records returned

SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE product_name LIKE '%berry%'
    LIMIT 50;


The query above retrieves all the records from the products table where the name contains the word berry. If we ran this query on the Amazon database, it would almost certainly return a lot of records.

The LIMIT statement only allows the database to return up to 50 records matching the query. This means that if there aren't that many records matching the query, the LIMIT statement will not have an effect.


LIMIT DOESN'T GIVE YOU EXACTLY THE LIMIT OF NUMBERS YOU GAVE IT TO THE CLAUSE IT WILL GIVE MAXIMUM THE NUMBER PROVIDED. 

ORDER BY:


The `ORDER BY` clause is used in SQL queries to sort the result set returned by a `SELECT` statement based on one or more columns. It allows you to specify the order in which the rows should be arranged, either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. Here's an overview of how the `ORDER BY` clause works:

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  [WHERE condition]
  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
  ```

- **Usage**:
  - After the `SELECT` statement, you specify the columns you want to retrieve data from.
  - The `FROM` clause specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.
  - Optionally, you can include a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on specified conditions.
  - The `ORDER BY` clause comes last and specifies the columns by which you want to sort the result set.
  - You can include multiple columns in the `ORDER BY` clause to perform a secondary sort if values in the first column are equal.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
  ```
  This query retrieves all rows from the `employees` table and sorts them in ascending order based on the `last_name` column. If multiple employees have the same last name, the rows are then sorted in ascending order based on the `first_name` column.

- **Sorting Direction**:
  - By default, sorting is performed in ascending order if not specified otherwise.
  - You can explicitly specify the sorting direction using `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) keywords after each column in the `ORDER BY` clause.

- **Column Types**:
  - Columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause can be of any data type, including numeric, string, date, or timestamp types.
  - The sorting behavior may vary based on the data type. For example, string sorting may be case-sensitive unless explicitly configured otherwise.

- **Performance**:
  - Sorting large result sets can impact query performance, especially if the database lacks appropriate indexes.
  - Indexes on the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause can improve sorting performance.

Overall, the `ORDER BY` clause is a crucial tool in SQL for arranging query results in a specific order, enabling you to retrieve data in a meaningful and organized manner.


ORDER BY
SQL also offers us the ability to sort the results of a query using ORDER BY. By default, the ORDER BY keyword sorts records by the given field in ascending order, or ASC for short. However, ORDER BY does support descending order as well with the keyword DESC.

EXAMPLES
This query returns the name, price, and quantity fields from the products table sorted by price in ascending order:

SELECT name, price, quantity FROM products
    ORDER BY price;

This query returns the name, price, and quantity of the products ordered by the quantity in descending order:

SELECT name, price, quantity FROM products
    ORDER BY quantity DESC;

   

        CHAPTER  7----------> AGGREGATIONS



        Aggregations in SQL are functions used to perform calculations on sets of rows to return single values as results. These functions are commonly used to derive summary statistics or to analyze data across multiple rows. Here's an overview of aggregations in SQL, along with answers to the provided 14 questions:

1. **What was the need to do this? Give 4 examples.**

   - Historical examples include the SUM, AVG, COUNT, and MAX functions available in early versions of SQL.

3. **If we do NOT use it, what will happen? Give 4 examples.**
   - Without aggregations, it would be challenging to derive meaningful insights from data.
   - For instance, you wouldn't be able to calculate total sales revenue, average ratings, customer counts, or maximum temperatures.

4. **What are the other options for doing this? Give 4 examples.**
   - Other options include processing data programmatically outside of SQL or using specialized analytical tools.

7. **When to NOT use it? Give 4 examples.**
   - Avoid using aggregations when dealing with individual records or when detailed information is needed.
   - Examples include retrieving specific customer details, fetching raw sensor data, displaying transaction logs, or accessing unprocessed event streams.

8. **How to use it? Give 4 examples.**
   - To use aggregations, simply apply aggregate functions to columns within a SQL query.
   - Examples include SELECT SUM(sales_amount), AVG(salary), COUNT(*) FROM employees, MAX(temperature) FROM weather_data.

9. **How to understand the principle of a tech working in a real-world non-tech scenario? Give 4 examples.**
   - In a non-tech scenario, aggregations can be compared to summarizing data in a sales report, calculating average scores in a class, counting inventory items in a warehouse, or finding the maximum temperature in a weather report.

10. **How to understand the principle of a tech working in a real-world tech scenario? Give 4 examples.**
    - In a tech scenario, aggregations are akin to computing total likes on social media posts, averaging ratings in a review system, counting user clicks on a website, or finding the peak traffic hours in a network log.

11. **What does each word in the line mean? Give 4 examples.**
    - Aggregations: Summarizing data across multiple rows.
    - SQL: Structured Query Language for managing relational databases.
    - Functions: Built-in operations in SQL for performing specific tasks.
    - Single values: Results returned by aggregations, typically representing summaries or analyses.

12. **What are other available ways to do the same thing? Give 4 examples.**

    - Example practices: Using meaningful aliases for aggregated columns, commenting queries for clarity, testing queries with sample data, and creating appropriate indexes for performance optimization.

14. **What are the harms of not following best practices, give examples?**
    - Not following best practices can lead to inaccurate analyses, inefficient queries, increased maintenance efforts, and potential security risks.
    - Examples: Incorrect financial reports due to flawed aggregations, slow query performance impacting user experience, data inconsistencies causing operational errors, and SQL injection vulnerabilities due to poorly written queries.

In summary, aggregations in SQL are essential for summarizing and analyzing data efficiently, providing valuable insights for decision-making processes in various industries and scenarios. Following best practices ensures accurate analyses, optimal performance, and maintainable codebases.


WHY AGGREGATIONS?
Data stored in a database should generally be stored raw. When we need to calculate some additional data from the raw data, we can use an aggregation.

Take the following count aggregation as an example

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM products
WHERE quantity = 0;

This query returns the number of products that have a quantity of 0. We could store a count of the products in a separate database table, and increment/decrement it whenever we make changes to the products table - but that would be redundant.

It's much simpler to store the products in a single place (we call this a single source of truth) and run an aggregation when we need to derive additional information from the raw data.

There are several types of aggregations commonly used in SQL to perform calculations on sets of data. Here are some of the most common types along with examples:

1. **SUM**: Calculates the sum of values in a column.
   - Example: Calculate the total sales revenue from the "sales" table.
     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue
     FROM sales;
     ```

2. **AVG**: Calculates the average (mean) value of a column.
   - Example: Calculate the average salary of employees from the "employees" table.
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```

3. **COUNT**: Counts the number of rows or non-null values in a column.
   - Example 1: Count the number of orders in the "orders" table.
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count
     FROM orders;
     ```
   - Example 2: Count the number of distinct product categories in the "products" table.
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS category_count
     FROM products;
     ```

4. **MIN**: Finds the minimum value in a column.
   - Example: Find the earliest hire date among employees in the "employees" table.
     ```sql
     SELECT MIN(hire_date) AS earliest_hire_date
     FROM employees;
     ```

5. **MAX**: Finds the maximum value in a column.
   - Example: Find the highest temperature recorded in the "weather_data" table.
     ```sql
     SELECT MAX(temperature) AS highest_temperature
     FROM weather_data;
     ```

6. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
   - Example: Calculate the total sales revenue for each product category.
     ```sql
     SELECT category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY category;
     ```

7. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on specified conditions.
   - Example: Find product categories with total sales revenue greater than $10,000.
     ```sql
     SELECT category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY category
     HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 10000;
     ```

These examples demonstrate how different types of aggregations can be used in SQL queries to perform various calculations and analyses on datasets.


WHERE CLAUSE COMES BEFORE ORDER BY CLAUSE AND HAVING COMES AFTER ORDER BY ALWAYS****************

WHERE - FILTERS THE ROWS ON GIVEN CRITERIA
 ORDER BY - DECRESES THE AMT OF DATA OR ROWS TO BE AND ORDER THEM ACCORDINGLY

 HAVING- FLITERS THE RESULTS OF ORDER BY TO GET DESUIRED DATA.


HAVING VS WHERE IN SQL
It's fairly common for developers to get confused about the difference between the HAVING and the WHERE clauses - they're pretty similar after all.

The difference is fairly simple in actuality:

A WHERE condition is applied to all the data in a query before it's grouped by a GROUP BY clause.
A HAVING condition is only applied to the grouped rows that are returned after a GROUP BY is applied.
This means that if you want to filter based on the result of an aggregation, you need to use HAVING. If you want to filter on a value that's present in the raw data, you should use a simple WHERE clause.


SELECT class_id, count(id) as class_size
FROM students
WHERE ...
GROUP BY class_id
HAVING ...



In the example, should you use a WHERE or a HAVING clause to filter down to a specific class_id?

WHERE


In the example, should you use a WHERE or a HAVING clause to filter down classes of a particular size?

HAVING

ROUND
Sometimes we need to round some numbers, particularly when working with the results of an aggregation. We can use the ROUND() function to get the job done.

The SQL round() function allows you to specify both the value you wish to round and the precision to which you wish to round it:

round(value, precision)



If no precision is given, SQL will round the value to the nearest whole value:

select song_name, round(avg(song_length), 1)
from songs

This query returns the average song_length from the songs table, rounded to a single decimal point.



        CHAPTER 8---> ADVANCED SUBQUERIES

SUBQUERIES
Sometimes a single query is not enough to retrieve the specific records we need.

It is possible to run a query on the result set of another query - a query within a query! This is called "query-ception"... erm... I mean a "subquery".

Subqueries can be very useful in a number of situations when trying to retrieve specific data that wouldn't be accessible by simply querying a single table.


RETRIEVING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TABLES
Here is an example of a subquery:

SELECT id, song_name, artist_id
FROM songs
WHERE artist_id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM artists
    WHERE artist_name LIKE 'Rick%'
);

In this hypothetical database, the query above selects all of the song_ids, song_names, and artist_ids from the songs table that are written by artists whose name starts with "Rick". Notice that the subquery allows us to use information from a different table - in this case the artists table.


SUBQUERY SYNTAX
The only syntax unique to a subquery is the parentheses surrounding the nested query. The IN operator could be different, for example, we could use the = operator if we expect a single value to be returned.



A SUBQUERY ALLOWS YOU TO QUERY THE RESULT SET OF A NESTED QUERY.

SELECT id, song_name, artist_id
FROM songs
WHERE artist_id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM artists
    WHERE artist_name LIKE 'Rick%'
);


EXAMPLE OF SUBQUERY RETURN  POTENTIALLY MANY RESULTS.

When working on a back-end application, this doesn't come up often, but it's important to remember that SQL is a full programming language. We usually use it to interact with data stored in tables, but it's quite flexible and powerful.

For example, you can SELECT information that's simply calculated, with no tables necessary.

SELECT 5 + 10 as sum;




When developing a backend application, the focus is typically on handling data operations and logic behind the scenes. While SQL is primarily known for its role in querying and manipulating data within tables, it's worth noting that SQL is a comprehensive programming language in its own right, offering versatility and power beyond just database interactions.

In SQL, you can perform calculations and operations directly within queries without the need for tables. This capability allows you to generate results that are dynamically computed based on specified expressions. For instance, consider the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 5 + 10 AS sum;
```

In this example, instead of querying data from a table, we're simply performing a calculation within the `SELECT` statement. The expression `5 + 10` evaluates to `15`, and we alias this result as `sum`. When executed, this query returns a single row with a single column named `sum`, containing the calculated value `15`.

This demonstrates the flexibility of SQL beyond traditional data retrieval and manipulation tasks. While it may not be a common use case in backend development, it's important to recognize SQL's broader capabilities as a programming language, which can come in handy for various scenarios, such as generating computed values or performing arithmetic operations directly within queries.




              CHAPTER 9-------> RELATIONS IN SQL


              In SQL, relations refer to the connections or associations between tables in a relational database. These relationships are established using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys, to link related rows across different tables. Here's an overview of relations in SQL:

1. **Types of Relationships**:
   - **One-to-One (1:1)**: Each row in one table is related to exactly one row in another table.
   - **One-to-Many (1:M)**: Each row in one table can be related to one or more rows in another table.
   - **Many-to-Many (M:M)**: Multiple rows in one table can be related to multiple rows in another table.

2. **Primary Key**:
   - A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.
   - It ensures that each row is unique and serves as a unique identifier for that entity.
   - Example: `id` column in a `users` table.

3. **Foreign Key**:
   - A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
   - It establishes a link between the two tables, representing a relationship between the entities they represent.
   - Example: `user_id` column in an `orders` table referencing the `id` column in the `users` table.

4. **Referential Integrity**:
   - Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain valid.
   - It enforces constraints to prevent actions that would violate these relationships, such as deleting a row referenced by a foreign key.
   - Example: Preventing deletion of a user record if there are associated orders in an orders table.

5. **SQL Constraints**:
   - Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to maintain data integrity.
   - Common constraints used to enforce relationships include `FOREIGN KEY` constraints and `UNIQUE` constraints.
   - Example: `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)` constraint in an orders table.

6. **Querying Related Tables**:
   - SQL allows you to retrieve data from related tables using `JOIN` operations.
   - Joins enable you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
   - Example: Joining the `users` table with the `orders` table to retrieve order details along with user information.

7. **Normalization**:
   - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency.
   - It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them.
   - Normalization helps maintain data integrity and reduces the risk of data anomalies.
   - Example: Splitting a single `employees` table into separate `employees` and `departments` tables, linked by a foreign key relationship.

In summary, relations in SQL are essential for modeling complex data structures and representing the associations between entities in a relational database. By establishing relationships between tables using keys and enforcing referential integrity, SQL enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation while maintaining data consistency and integrity.




Certainly! Let's address the 14 questions in the context of relations in SQL:

1. **What was the need to do this? Give 4 examples.**
   - Establishing relationships between tables ensures data integrity and reduces redundancy in the database.
   - Examples: Managing orders for customers, tracking employees assigned to projects, organizing products by categories, linking comments to articles in a blog.

2. **What is the history of this? Understand with examples? Give 4 examples.**
   - The concept of relations in databases dates back to the inception of the relational model by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s.
   - Historical examples include the development of relational database management systems (RDBMS) like IBM's System R, Oracle, Ingres, and MySQL.

3. **If we do NOT use it, what will happen? Give 4 examples.**
   - Without establishing relations, data redundancy and inconsistency may occur, leading to integrity issues.
   - Examples: Duplicate customer information in multiple tables, orphaned records in child tables, inconsistent product categorization, and incomplete order information.

4. **What are the other options for doing this? Give 4 examples.**
   - Other options include using denormalized data models, NoSQL databases, graph databases, or document-oriented databases.
   - Examples: Storing nested data structures in JSON documents, using key-value stores, employing graph databases for highly interconnected data, or using flat file storage.

5. **Why to use it? Give 4 examples.**
   - Using relations ensures data consistency, reduces redundancy, simplifies data maintenance, and supports data integrity.
   - Examples: Ensuring each product belongs to only one category, maintaining accurate customer order history, avoiding data duplication, and enforcing business rules.

6. **When to use it? Give 4 examples.**
   - Relations are used when data entities have clear associations and dependencies with each other.
   - Examples: Managing employee schedules, tracking student enrollment in courses, recording customer transactions, and organizing inventory items in a warehouse.

7. **When to NOT use it? Give 4 examples.**
   - Relations may not be necessary for small, simple datasets or when data entities have no logical connections.
   - Examples: Personal to-do lists, simple configuration files, standalone microservices, and temporary data storage for short-lived processes.

8. **How to use it? Give 4 examples.**
   - To establish relations, define foreign keys in child tables referencing primary keys in parent tables.
   - Examples: Creating a foreign key constraint to link orders to customers, referencing product IDs in order line items, linking comments to blog posts, and associating employees with their managers.

9. **How to understand the principle of a tech working in a real-world non-tech scenario? Give 4 examples.**
   - Relate the concept of relations in SQL to real-world scenarios such as organizing library books by author, categorizing recipes by cuisine, managing event attendees, and assigning tasks to team members in project management.

10. **How to understand the principle of a tech working in a real-world tech scenario? Give 4 examples.**
    - Relate SQL relations to scenarios like organizing GitHub repositories by owner, tracking customer interactions in a CRM system, managing user permissions in a web application, and modeling network connections in a social media platform.

11. **What does each word in the line mean? Give 4 examples.**
    - Break down terms like primary key, foreign key, relationships, and integrity constraints with examples specific to SQL.

12. **What are other available ways to do the same thing? Give 4 examples.**
    - Explore alternatives like using flat file databases, NoSQL databases, graph databases, or object-oriented databases for data storage and management.

13. **What are the best industry standards practices, and what is needed to do so? Give 4 examples.**
    - Industry best practices include adhering to normalization principles, defining clear relationships, enforcing referential integrity, and documenting database schemas.
    - Examples: Normalizing data to eliminate redundancy, using surrogate keys for stability, defining foreign keys for data consistency, and documenting database designs.

14. **What are the harms of not following best practices, give examples?**
    - Failure to establish proper relations can lead to data anomalies such as data duplication, orphaned records, inconsistent data, and difficulty in maintaining data quality.
    - Examples: Duplicate customer records causing billing errors, orphaned order records after customer deletion, inconsistent product categorization leading to inaccurate reporting, and data inconsistencies impacting business decisions.

In summary, understanding relations in SQL is crucial for maintaining data integrity, consistency, and efficiency in database management. Properly establishing and managing relationships between tables ensures accurate data representation and supports effective data querying and manipulation.


EXAMPLE OF  1 TO 1 RELATION  -->A TRANSACTIONS NOTE



EXAMPLES OF ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS
A customers table and a orders table. Each customer has 0, 1, or many orders that they've placed.
A users table and a transactions table. Each user has 0, 1, or many transactions that taken part in.

Sure, let's delve deeper into each term individually:

**Metadata**:
Metadata, in the context of databases, refers to data that provides information about other data stored in the database. It includes details about the structure, organization, and properties of database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, constraints, and relationships. Metadata can be queried from system catalog tables or views provided by the database management system (DBMS). It serves several purposes:

1. **Structural Information**: Metadata describes the structure of database objects, including tables, columns, and indexes. It provides details such as names, data types, lengths, and nullability of columns.

2. **Relationships**: Metadata defines relationships between database objects, such as primary key-foreign key relationships between tables. It specifies which columns are linked between tables and the cardinality of the relationships.

3. **Constraints**: Metadata includes information about constraints applied to database objects, such as primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and check constraints. It specifies the rules and conditions that data must adhere to.

4. **Indexes**: Metadata describes indexes created on tables to improve query performance. It includes details about the columns included in indexes, their ordering, and uniqueness.

5. **Statistics**: Metadata may contain statistics about database objects, such as the number of rows in a table, the distribution of values in columns, and the size of indexes. This information is used by the query optimizer to generate efficient query execution plans.

In SQL, metadata can be queried using system catalog tables or views provided by the DBMS. Commonly used catalog tables include `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`, and `SYS.TABLES` (specific to certain DBMS). Understanding metadata is crucial for database administrators, developers, and analysts to effectively manage, query, and analyze data stored in the database.

**Joining Tables**:
Joining tables in SQL is the process of combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query and create a virtual table that contains columns from both tables. Joining tables is a fundamental operation in SQL and is commonly used to retrieve related data from normalized databases. Here are the key aspects of joining tables:

1. **Join Types**: SQL supports different types of joins, including inner join, left join (or left outer join), right join (or right outer join), full outer join, and cross join. Each join type determines how rows are combined from the participating tables based on the join condition.

2. **Join Conditions**: A join condition specifies the criteria for combining rows from two tables. It typically involves comparing values in columns that are related between the tables. Commonly used join conditions include equality comparisons (`ON` clause) and inequality comparisons (`WHERE` clause).

3. **Table Aliases**: When joining multiple tables, it's common to use table aliases to simplify the SQL syntax and avoid ambiguity. Table aliases provide shorthand names for tables, making the query more readable.

4. **Multiple Joins**: SQL allows you to join more than two tables in a single query by chaining multiple join operations together. This enables you to retrieve data from complex relationships involving multiple tables.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Joining tables can impact query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Proper indexing, efficient join strategies, and query optimization techniques are essential for improving join performance.

In summary, joining tables in SQL is a powerful feature that allows you to retrieve related data from multiple tables in a database. Understanding different join types, join conditions, and performance considerations is essential for writing efficient SQL queries that meet the requirements of your application.


EXAMPLES OF MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS
A products table and a suppliers table - Products may have 0 to many suppliers, and suppliers can supply 0 to many products.
A classes table and a students table - Students can take potentially many classes and classes can have many students enrolled.

UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ACROSS 2 FIELDS
When enforcing specific schema constraints we may need to enforce the UNIQUE constraint across two different fields.

CREATE TABLE product_suppliers (
  product_id INTEGER,
  supplier_id INTEGER,
  UNIQUE(product_id, supplier_id)
);


This ensures that we can have multiple rows with the same product_id or supplier_id, but we can't have two rows where both the product_id and supplier_id are the same.



DATABASE NORMALIZATION
Database normalization is a method for structuring your database schema in a way that helps:

Improve data integrity
Reduce data redundancy


WHAT IS DATA INTEGRITY?
"Data integrity" refers to the accuracy and consistency of data. For example, if a user's age is stored in a database, rather than their birthday, that data becomes incorrect automatically with the passage of time.

It would be better to store a birthday and calculate the age as needed.

WHAT IS DATA REDUNDANCY?
"Data redundancy" occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places. For example: saving the same file multiple times to different hard drives.

Data redundancy can be problematic, especially when data in one place is changed such that the data is no longer consistent across all copies of that data.

NORMAL FORMS
The creator of "database normalization", Edgar F. Codd described different "normal forms" a database can adhere to. We'll talk about the most common ones.

First normal form (1NF)
Second normal form (2NF)
Third normal form (3NF)
Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)

In short, 1st normal form is the least "normalized" form, and Boyce-Codd is the most "normalized" form.

The more normalized a database, the better its data integrity, and the less duplicate data you'll have.

IN THE CONTEXT OF NORMAL FORMS, "PRIMARY KEY" MEANS SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT
In the context of database normalization, we're going to use the term "primary key" slightly differently. When we're talking about SQLite, a "primary key" is a single column that uniquely identifies a row.

When we're talking more generally about data normalization, the term "primary key" means the collection of columns that uniquely identify a row. That can be a single column, but it can actually be any number of columns that form a composite key. A primary key is the minimum number of columns needed to uniquely identify a row in a table.

If you think back to the many-to-many joining table product_suppliers, that table's "primary key" was actually a combination of the 2 ids, product_id and supplier_id:


WHICH FORM ENCOURAGES THE MOST ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE INFORMATION:-BCNF

IN THE CONTEXT OF NORMALIZATION A PRIMARY KEY IS MADE UP OF____ TABLE COLUMNS.

1-MANY.


1ST NORMAL FORM (1NF)
To be compliant with first normal form, a database table simply needs to follow 2 rules:

It must have a unique primary key.
A cell can't have a nested table as its value (depending on the database you're using, this may not even be possible)
EXAMPLE OF NOT 1ST NORMAL FORM
name	age	email
Lane	27	lane@boot.dev
Lane	27	lane@boot.dev
Allan	27	allan@boot.dev
This table does not adhere to 1NF. It has two identical rows, so there isn't a unique primary key for each row.

EXAMPLE OF 1ST NORMAL FORM
The simplest way (but not the only way) to get into first normal form is to add a unique id column.

id	name	age	email
1	Lane	27	lane@boot.dev
2	Lane	27	lane@boot.dev
3	Allan	27	allan@boot.dev
It's worth noting that if you create a "primary key" by ensuring that two columns are always "unique together" that works too.

YOU SHOULD ALMOST NEVER DESIGN A TABLE THAT DOESN'T ADHERE TO 1NF
First normal form is simply a good idea. I've never built a database schema where each table isn't at least in first normal form.


BOYCE-CODD NORMAL FORM (BCNF)
A table in Boyce-Codd normal form (created by Raymond F Boyce and Edgar F Codd) follows all the rules of 3rd normal form, plus one additional rule:

A column that's part of a primary key can not be entirely dependent on a column that's not part of that primary key.
This only comes into play when there are multiple possible primary key combinations that overlap. Another name for this is "overlapping candidate keys".

Only in rare cases does a table in third normal form not meet the requirements of Boyce-Codd normal form!

EXAMPLE OF 3RD NF, BUT NOT BOYCE-CODD NF
release_year	release_date	sales	name
2001	2001-01-02	100	Kiss me tender
2001	2001-02-04	200	Bloody Mary
2002	2002-04-14	100	I wanna be them
2002	2002-06-24	200	He got me
The interesting thing here is that there are 3 possible primary keys:

release_year + sales
release_date + sales
name
This means that by definition this table is in 2nd and 3rd normal form because those forms only restrict how dependent a column that is not part of a primary key can be.

This table is not in Boyce-Codd's normal form because release_year is entirely dependent on release_date.

EXAMPLE OF BOYCE-CODD NORMAL FORM
The easiest way to fix the table in our example is to simply remove the duplicate data from release_date. Let's make that column release_day_and_month.

release_year	release_day_and_month	sales	name
2001	01-02	100	Kiss me tender
2001	02-04	200	Bloody Mary
2002	04-14	100	I wanna be them
2002	06-24	200	He got me
BCNF IS USUALLY A GOOD IDEA
The same exact rule of thumb applies to the 2nd, 3rd and Boyce-Codd normal forms. That said, it's unlikely you'll see BCNF-specific issues in practice.

Optimize for data integrity.



         CHAPTER 10 -------> JOINS

In SQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query and create a virtual table that contains columns from both tables. Joins are a fundamental aspect of querying relational databases and are crucial for retrieving related data. Here's an overview of joins in SQL:

1. **Types of Joins**:
   SQL supports several types of joins, including:
   - **Inner Join**: Returns rows from both tables where there is a match based on the join condition.
   - **Left Join (or Left Outer Join)**: Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are included for columns from the right table.
   - **Right Join (or Right Outer Join)**: Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are included for columns from the left table.
   - **Full Outer Join**: Returns all rows from both tables, combining rows when there is a match and including NULL values when there is no match.
   - **Cross Join**: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, resulting in a combination of every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

2. **Join Conditions**:
   - Join conditions specify the criteria for combining rows from the participating tables.
   - The most common join condition is an equality comparison between columns in the tables being joined.
   - Join conditions are typically specified using the `ON` clause in SQL, although they can also be specified in the `WHERE` clause for inner joins.

3. **Table Aliases**:
   - Table aliases provide shorthand names for tables, making SQL queries more readable and concise.
   - Aliases are often used when joining multiple tables to simplify the syntax, especially when tables have long or complex names.

4. **Syntax**:
   - The basic syntax for joins in SQL typically involves specifying the type of join (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) followed by the name of the second table and the join condition.
   - For example:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM table1
     INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
     ```

5. **Multiple Joins**:
   - SQL allows you to join more than two tables in a single query by chaining multiple join operations together.
   - Each additional join is specified using the same syntax as the first join, and join conditions can be combined using logical operators (e.g., `AND`, `OR`).

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Joining large tables or joining tables without appropriate indexes can impact query performance.
   - Proper indexing, efficient join strategies, and query optimization techniques are essential for improving join performance.

In summary, joins in SQL are essential for retrieving related data from multiple tables in a relational database. Understanding different join types, join conditions, and performance considerations is crucial for writing efficient SQL queries that meet the requirements of your application.

JOINS
Joins are one of the most important features that SQL offers. Joins allow us to make use of the relationships we have set up between our tables. In short, joins allow us to query multiple tables at the same time.

INNER JOIN
The simplest and most common type of join in SQL is the INNER JOIN. By default, a JOIN command is an INNER JOIN. An INNER JOIN returns all of the records in table_a that have matching records in table_b as demonstrated by the following Venn diagram.

inner join

ON
In order to perform a join, we need to tell the database which fields should be "matched up". The ON clause is used to specify these columns to join.

SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
Copy icon
The query above returns all the fields from both tables. The INNER keyword doesn't have anything to do with the number of columns returned - it only affects the number of rows returned.

LEFT JOIN:
NAMESPACING ON TABLES
When working with multiple tables, you can specify which table a field exists on using a .. For example:

table_name.column_name

SELECT students.name, classes.name
FROM students
INNER JOIN classes on classes.class_id = students.class_id;
Copy icon
The above query returns the name field from the students table and the name field from the classes table.


Sure, let's dive into each type of join, including LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and INNER JOIN:

1. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**:
   - The LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
   - If there is no matching row in the right table, NULL values are included for columns from the right table.
   - This type of join ensures that all rows from the left table are included in the result set, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the right table.
   - Syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM table1
     LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
     ```

2. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**:
   - The RIGHT JOIN is similar to the LEFT JOIN but returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
   - If there is no matching row in the left table, NULL values are included for columns from the left table.
   - This type of join ensures that all rows from the right table are included in the result set, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the left table.
   - Syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM table1
     RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
     ```

3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**:
   - The FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both tables, combining rows when there is a match and including NULL values when there is no match.
   - This type of join ensures that all rows from both tables are included in the result set.
   - Syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM table1
     FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
     ```

4. **INNER JOIN**:
   - The INNER JOIN returns rows from both tables where there is a match based on the join condition.
   - It excludes rows from either table if there is no matching row in the other table.
   - Syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM table1
     INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
     ```

These are the main types of joins in SQL. Each type serves a different purpose and is used based on the specific requirements of the query. Understanding these join types and their syntax is essential for writing effective SQL queries that retrieve the desired data from multiple tables.



          CHAPTER 11 -----> PERFORMANCE



It seems like you're interested in discussing performance in SQL. SQL performance can be influenced by various factors including query design, indexing, database schema, hardware resources, and database optimization techniques. Here are some key points to consider for improving SQL performance:

1. **Optimize Queries**: Ensure that your SQL queries are well-written and optimized. Avoid using unnecessary joins, subqueries, and overly complex logic. Use EXPLAIN or similar tools to analyze query execution plans and identify potential bottlenecks.

2. **Indexing**: Proper indexing can significantly improve query performance. Identify columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses, and create appropriate indexes on those columns. However, be cautious not to over-index as it can lead to overhead during data modification operations.

3. **Database Design**: A well-designed database schema can contribute to better performance. Normalize your database structure to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. Use appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data consistency and efficiency.

4. **Data Partitioning**: For large datasets, consider partitioning your tables based on certain criteria such as date ranges or key ranges. This can help distribute data across multiple physical storage devices and improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.

5. **Query Caching**: Utilize query caching mechanisms provided by your database management system to cache frequently executed queries and their results. This can reduce the overhead of query compilation and processing, especially for read-heavy workloads.

6. **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling to reuse database connections and minimize the overhead of establishing new connections for each request. This can improve scalability and performance, especially in web applications with multiple concurrent users.

7. **Database Tuning**: Regularly monitor and tune your database configuration parameters such as memory allocation, buffer sizes, and concurrency settings to optimize performance based on workload characteristics and hardware resources.

8. **Avoid Cursors**: Whenever possible, avoid using cursors in SQL as they can be inefficient, especially for large datasets. Instead, use set-based operations and bulk processing techniques to perform operations efficiently.

9. **Regular Maintenance**: Perform regular maintenance tasks such as vacuuming, reindexing, and statistics updates to ensure optimal performance and prevent database fragmentation over time.

10. **Use Analytical Functions**: Take advantage of SQL analytical functions (e.g., window functions) for complex data analysis tasks. These functions are optimized for performance and can often provide better performance compared to traditional SQL constructs.

By following these best practices and continuously monitoring and optimizing your SQL queries and database infrastructure, you can achieve better performance and scalability for your applications.


SQL INDEXES
An index is an in-memory structure that ensures that queries we run on a database are performant, that is to say, they run quickly. If you can remember back to the data structures course, most database indexes are just binary trees or B-trees! The binary tree can be stored in ram as well as on disk, and it makes it easy to lookup the location of an entire row.

PRIMARY KEY columns are indexed by default, ensuring you can look up a row by its id very quickly. However, if you have other columns that you want to be able to do quick lookups on, you'll need to index them.

CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX index_name on table_name (column_name);
Copy icon
It's fairly common to name an index after the column it's created on with a suffix of _idx.


a binary tree index makes lookups----->O(log(n))

add indexes to columns that you frequently perform lookup on.

indexes slow down read speed.


INDEX REVIEW
As we discussed, an index is a data structure that can perform quick lookups. By indexing a column, we create a new in-memory structure, usually a binary-tree, where the values in the indexed column are sorted into the tree to keep lookups fast. In terms of Big-O complexity, a binary tree index ensures that lookups are O(log(n)).

SHOULDN'T WE INDEX EVERYTHING? WE CAN MAKE THE DATABASE ULTRA-FAST!
While indexes make specific kinds of lookups much faster, they also add performance overhead - they can slow down a database in other ways. Think about it, if you index every column, you could have hundreds of binary trees in memory! That needlessly bloats the memory usage of your database. It also means that each time you insert a record, that record needs to be added to many trees - slowing down your insert speed.

The rule of thumb is simple:

Add an index to columns you know you'll be doing frequent lookups on. Leave everything else un-indexed. You can always add indexes later.

MULTI-COLUMN INDEXES
Multi-column indexes are useful for the exact reason you might think - they speed up lookups that depend on multiple columns.

CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX first_name_last_name_age_idx
ON users (first_name, last_name, age);
Copy icon
A multi-column index is sorted by the first column first, the second column next, and so forth. A lookup on only the first column in a multi-column index gets almost all of the performance improvements that it would get from its own single-column index. However, lookups on only the second or third column will have very degraded performance.

RULE OF THUMB
Unless you have specific reasons to do something special, only add multi-column indexes if you're doing frequent lookups on a specific combination of columns.


Certainly! Here's an explanation of denormalization with examples, broken down into points:

1. **Reduction in Joins**:
   - In normalized databases, data is often distributed across multiple tables, requiring joins to retrieve related information.
   - Denormalization involves consolidating related data into fewer tables, reducing the need for joins in queries.
   - Example: Suppose we have a normalized schema for an e-commerce application with separate tables for customers, orders, and products. In a denormalized schema, we might combine customer and order information into a single table to simplify queries related to order history.

2. **Improved Query Performance**:
   - By reducing the number of joins required, denormalization can significantly improve query performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.
   - Queries that previously involved multiple joins become simpler and faster to execute.
   - Example: A query to retrieve a customer's order history, including product details, can be executed more efficiently in a denormalized schema compared to a normalized schema with separate tables for customers, orders, and products.

3. **Data Duplication**:
   - Denormalization involves duplicating data across multiple tables or columns to avoid joins.
   - Redundant data is stored to optimize query performance and simplify data retrieval.
   - Example: In a denormalized schema for a blogging platform, we might store both the author's name and the post title within the same table as the post content, eliminating the need to join with separate author and post tables.

4. **Reduced Complexity**:
   - Denormalization simplifies the database schema by reducing the number of tables and eliminating complex join operations.
   - This simplification makes the database structure easier to understand and maintain.
   - Example: In a denormalized schema for a social media platform, user profile information and post data might be combined into a single table, reducing the complexity of queries related to user activity and interactions.

5. **Optimized Read Operations**:
   - Denormalization optimizes read operations by precalculating and storing derived data, such as aggregated values or summaries.
   - This eliminates the need for expensive calculations or aggregations during query execution.
   - Example: In an e-commerce database, denormalization might involve storing precomputed totals for order amounts, quantities, and discounts, making it faster to generate reports and analyze sales data.

6. **Flexibility in Query Design**:
   - Denormalization provides flexibility in query design, allowing developers to optimize queries based on specific use cases and performance requirements.
   - Developers can tailor the database schema to meet the needs of the application without being constrained by strict normalization rules.
   - Example: In a denormalized schema for a content management system, we might include redundant metadata fields within the same table as the content to support fast and flexible search queries.

7. **Consideration of Trade-offs**:
   - While denormalization offers performance benefits, it also introduces trade-offs such as increased storage requirements, data redundancy, and the risk of update anomalies.
   - It's essential to carefully consider these trade-offs and evaluate the impact on data integrity and storage costs.
   - Example: In a denormalized database, redundant data may need to be synchronized or updated consistently to avoid inconsistencies, which can add complexity to data management tasks.

DENORMALIZING FOR SPEED
We left you with a cliffhanger in the "normalization" chapter. As it turns out, data integrity and deduplication come at a cost, and that cost is usually speed.

Joining tables together, using subqueries, performing aggregations, and running post-hoc calculations take time. At very large scales these advanced techniques can actually become a huge performance toll on an application - sometimes grinding the database server to a halt.

Storing duplicate information can drastically speed up an application that needs to look it up in different ways. For example, if you store a user's country information right on their user record, no expensive join is required to load their profile page!

That said, denormalize at your own risk! Denormalizing a database incurs a large risk of inaccurate and buggy data.

In my opinion, it should be used as a kind of "last resort" in the name of speed.


In summary, denormalization is a database optimization technique that aims to improve query performance and simplify data retrieval by reducing the complexity of the database schema and minimizing the need for joins. While denormalization offers significant performance benefits, it's essential to weigh the trade-offs and carefully design the database schema to ensure data integrity and optimize query performance effectively.


SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters of a web application's SQL query. This code is then executed by the application's database, allowing the attacker to manipulate the database or obtain sensitive information.

Here are some key points about SQL injection:

1. **Vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerabilities typically arise when an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's queries.

2. **Types of SQL Injection**:
   - **In-band SQL Injection**: In this type, the attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results. This is the most common type of SQL injection.
   - **Blind SQL Injection**: In this type, the attacker is unable to see the result of the attack directly but can still infer information based on the application's behavior.
   - **Out-of-band SQL Injection**: In this type, the attacker is able to extract data using a different communication channel than the one used to launch the attack.

3. **Impact**:
   - SQL injection attacks can have serious consequences, including data theft, data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and even complete compromise of the affected system.
   - Attackers can use SQL injection to bypass authentication mechanisms, execute administrative commands, retrieve, modify, or delete database records, and perform other malicious actions.

4. **Prevention**:
   - The primary defense against SQL injection is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which separate SQL code from user input and prevent malicious injection.
   - Input validation and sanitization are also crucial. Ensure that all user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
   - Employing least privilege principles, such as using database accounts with minimal permissions, can limit the potential damage of successful SQL injection attacks.
   - Regular security testing, code reviews, and security audits can help identify and address SQL injection vulnerabilities in applications.

5. **Examples**:
   - An attacker might inject SQL code into a login form to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
   - By manipulating input parameters in a search form or URL, an attacker could modify the SQL query to retrieve sensitive information from the database.
   - In an e-commerce application, an attacker could exploit SQL injection to modify prices, manipulate inventory levels, or steal customer information from the database.

In summary, SQL injection is a serious security vulnerability that can have severe consequences for web applications and databases. Preventing SQL injection requires a combination of secure coding practices, input validation, parameterized queries, and regular security testing to protect against this common and potentially devastating attack vector.



SQL INJECTION
SQL is a very common way hackers attempt to cause damage or breach a database. One of my favorite XKCD comics of all time demonstrates the problem:

bobby tables

The joke here is that if someone was using this query:

INSERT INTO students(name) VALUES (?);



And the "name" of a student was 'Robert'); DROP TABLE students;-- then the resulting SQL query would look like this:

INSERT INTO students(name) VALUES ('Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--);


As you can see, this is actually 2 queries! The first one inserts "Robert" into the database, and the second one deletes the students table!

HOW DO WE PROTECT AGAINST SQL INJECTION?
You need to be aware of SQL injection attacks, but to be honest the solution these days is to simply use a modern SQL library that sanitizes SQL inputs. We don't often need to sanitize inputs by hand at the application level anymore.

For example, the Go standard library's SQL packages automatically protects your inputs against SQL attacks if you use it properly. In short, don't interpolate user input into raw strings yourself - make sure your database library has a way to sanitize inputs, and pass it those raw values.


SQL injection is best avoided by using a modern SQL package that handles the sanitization of user-provided values--->TRUE
